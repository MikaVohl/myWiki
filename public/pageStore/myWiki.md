**MyWiki** is a personal journey to fill out pages of Wikipedia topics with your own knowledge. It helps you build broad and deep understanding on any topics you choose, and gamifies it by adding a sort of progression or competition to the task.

- At the bottom of each topic field, you can switch between other people's entries for that specific topic.
- There is a glossary of entries you have filled.
- Page titles are based on real Wikipedia entries, but custom entries are also allowed.
